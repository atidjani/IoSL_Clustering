 *  The {@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.KDDTask} main routine expects an algorithm to implement
 *  the {@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.algorithm.Algorithm}-Interface.
 *  Basic functions are already provided within {@link de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.algorithm.AbstractAlgorithm},
 *  see there for basic instructions of how to implement an algorithm suitable to the framework.
