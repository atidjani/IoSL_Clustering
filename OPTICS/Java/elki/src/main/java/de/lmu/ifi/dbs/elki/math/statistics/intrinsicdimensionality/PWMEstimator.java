/**
 * Probability weighted moments based estimator.
 *
 * We use the unbiased weights of Maciunas Landwehr et al.:
 * <p>
 * J. Maciunas Landwehr and N. C. Matalas and J. R. Wallis<br />
 * Probability weighted moments compared with some traditional techniques in
 * estimating Gumbel parameters and quantiles.<br />
 * Water Resources Research 15.5 (1979): 1055-1064.
 * </p>
 * but we pretend we had one additional data point at 0, to not lose valuable
 * data. When implemented exactly, we would have to assign a weight of 0 to the
 * first point. But since we are not using the mean, we don't want to do this.
 * This hack causes this estimator to have a bias to underestimate the ID.
