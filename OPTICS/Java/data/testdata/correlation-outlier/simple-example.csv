# This is a simple example with 7 points on a dense (axis-parallel) line,
# one point which is an outlier on the line ('correlated') and one point
# which is close to the dense line, but not on the actual correlation.
#
# Usual outlier detections will give 'Correlated' a high score
# While a correlation outlier algorithm should give 'Outlier' the highest score.
