Description: A fast reimplementation of several density-based algorithms of
    the DBSCAN family for spatial data. Includes the DBSCAN (density-based spatial
    clustering of applications with noise) and OPTICS (ordering points to identify
    the clustering structure) clustering algorithms and the LOF (local outlier
    factor) algorithm. The implementations uses the kd-tree data structure (from
    library ANN) for faster k-nearest neighbor search. An R interface to fast kNN
    and fixed-radius NN search is also provided.
