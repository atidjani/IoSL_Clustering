[![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/mhahsler/dbscan?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mhahsler/dbscan)

 This R package provides a fast C++ reimplementation of several density-based algorithms of the DBSCAN 
 family for spatial data. 
 Includes the __DBSCAN__ (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) and 
 __OPTICS__ (ordering points to identify the clustering structure) clustering algorithms and the 
 __LOF__ (local outlier factor) algorithm. The implementations uses the kd-tree data 
 structure (from library ANN) for faster k-nearest neighbor search. 
 An R interface to __fast kNN and fixed-radius NN search__ is also provided.

This implementation is typically faster than the native R implementation in package `fpc`, or the 
implementations in WEKA, ELKI and Python's scikit-learn.

## Installation

* __Stable CRAN version:__ install from within R.
* __Current development version:__ Download package from [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mhahsler/dbscan/build/artifacts) or install via `intall_github("mhahsler/dbscan")` (requires devtools) 

## Examples
```R
library("dbscan")

## use the numeric variables in the iris dataset
data("iris")
x <- as.matrix(iris[, 1:4])
 
## DBSCAN
db <- dbscan(x, eps = .4, minPts = 4)
db
## visualize results (noise is shown in black)
pairs(x, col = db$cluster + 1L)

## LOF (local outlier factor) 
lof <- lof(x, k = 4)
## larger bubbles in the visualization have a larger LOF
pairs(x, cex = lof)

## OPTICS
opt <- optics(x, eps = 1, minPts = 4, eps_cl = .4)
opt
## create a reachability plot (extracted DBSCAN clusters at eps_cl=.4 are colored)
plot(opt)
## plot the extracted DBSCAN clustering
pairs(x, col = opt$cluster + 1L)
```
